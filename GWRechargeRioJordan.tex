 \abstract{
 %\textbf{Background:57} 
 Groundwater management requires a proper characterization of the spatial and temporal variation of the groundwater recharge. GIS-based methods have become a viable alternative for groundwater recharge estimation. 
 %\textbf{Problem:23} 
 This is specially important in data-scarce regions such as the Jordan River Watershed in Colombia where no groundwater monitoring network, shallow aquifers and incipient use of groundwater.  
 %\textbf{Methods:76} 
In this study, the groundwater recharge is estimated using a GIS-based soil water balance model that considers the spatial variation in the topography, soil and hydrological properties in the study area for different water years.
 %\textbf{Results:68} 
 The spatial and long-term average of the annual rainfall of \SI{702}{\milli \meter} in a normal year is distributed as: surface runoff of \SI{292.4}{\milli \meter} (41.64\%), actual evapotranspiration of \SI{408.4}{\milli \meter} (52.8\%) and recharge of \SI{6.4}{\milli \meter} (0.9\%). The spatial and long-term average of the annual rainfall reduces to \SI{490}{\milli \meter} in dry years and increases to \SI{900}{\milli \meter} in wet years. The percentages of the surface runoff and actual evapotranspiration do not change according to the water years, whereas the recharge reduces to \SI{0.0}{\milli \meter} in dry years and \SI{33.4}{\milli \meter} (3.6\%) during wet years.
 %\textbf{Conclusion:22} 
 These recharge estimates corresponds to \SI{64.5}{\litre \per \second} during a normal year that increases to \SI{337}{\litre \per \second} during a wet year for a \SI{318.2}{\kilo \meter \squared} watershed. Therefore, the spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge should be considered in the formulation of a sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the Jordan River watershed.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Soil Water Balance}


The soil water balance for a raster cell at a given month $i$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
P_{i}=R_{i}+AET_{i}+CWS_{i}+REC_{i}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_{i}$ is the precipitation 
\item $AET_{i}$ is the actual evapotranspiration
\item $CWS_{i}$ is the change in the water stored in the soil
\item $REC_{i}$ is the recharge
\end{itemize}
The surface runoff is calculated using the rational approach as the product of the runoff coefficients and the precipitation:
\begin{equation}
R_{i}=RC \times P_{i}
\end{equation}
where $RC$ is the runoff coefficient which depends on the soil type and use, and slope. 

The infiltration is the difference between the precipitation and the surface runoff:
\begin{equation}
IN_{i}=P_{i}-R_{i}
\end{equation}

The difference between infiltration and potential evapotranspiration is called IN-PET
\begin{equation}
INPET_{i}=IN_{i}-PET_{i}
\end{equation}
A positive INPET indicates a potential accumulation of water in the soil, whereas  the soil is drying if the INPET is negative. 

The accumulated water loss is the sum of the negative values of the INPET since the beginning of the year:
\begin{equation}
AWL_{i}=\sum\limits_{j=0}^{i}\text{NEG}(INPET_{j})
\end{equation}
The water stored in the soil can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
WS_{i}=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&FC \times 10^{(b \times INPET_{i})} &\text{If } INPET_{i} < 0 \\
	&WS_{i-1} & \text{If } INPET_{i} > 0
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
b=\frac{0.455}{FC}
\end{equation}
and $FC$ is the field capacity

The change in water storage is the difference between the water stored for a given month and the water stored in a previous month:
\begin{equation}
CWS_{i}=WS_{i}-WS_{i-1}
\end{equation}

There is actual evapotranspiration if  INPET is positive, that, is, the infiltration exceeds the potential evapotranspiration:
$$
AET_{i}=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&PET_{i} &\text{If } INPET_{i} \ge 0 \\
	&PET_{i}+[INPET_{i}-CWS_{i}] &\text{If } INPET_{i} < 0 \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

The recharge can be calculate as follows:
$$
REC_{i}=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&INPET_{i}-CWS_{i} &\text{If } INPET_{i}>0\\
	&0 &\text{If } INPET_{i}<0\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Answer Research Questions. Defend Answer with Results
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Q1: Magnitude (annual recharge). 
		%Results shown in Figure \ref{fig:recharge_annual} indicate that groundwater recharge heavily depends  on the amount of precipitation over the study area. There is only \SI{10}{\milli \meter} of recharge to the aquifer in the north part of the study area during the dry years (see Fig. \ref{fig:recharge_annual}b), and there is no recharge in the aquifers located near the city of Tunja (SW part of the study area). 
		%During a normal year, the annual recharge ranges between \qtyrange{50}{100}{\milli \meter} in the NE part of the study area in the Tilatá Fm and Quaternary deposits in Tuta municipality and in the Guaduas, Bogotá and Titalá Formations in Combita municipality, respectively.  The  annual recharge increases to \qtyrange{100}{200}{\milli \meter}.
		
		From the results, there are second recharge zones located in the study area. The first area called NE recharge area is located in the Tuta and Combita municipalities (see Fig. location) and it is characterized by annual recharges between \qtyrange{50}{100}{\milli \meter} during the normal years that increases to  \qtyrange{100}{200}{\milli \meter}  during wet years. The aquifers associated with this recharge zone include confined aquifers of the Tilata Fm and phreatic to locally confined aquifers in the Quaternary deposits.
		
		The second recharge area is located near Tunja municipality (capital of Boyaca state) and it is characterized by annual recharges between \qtyrange{20}{130}{\milli \meter} during the wet years with nill recharge during the dry and normal years. The aquifers associated with this recharge zones mainly include confined aquifers of the Bogota Formation.
		
		
		
		    
		\item Q2: Places where recharge is high/low
		\item Q3: Months where recharge is high.
