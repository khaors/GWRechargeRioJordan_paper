	abstract = {Improvement in modern water resource management has become increasingly reliant on better characterizing of the spatial variability of groundwater recharge mechanisms. Due to the flexibility and reliability of GIS-based index models, they have become an alternative for mapping and interpreting recharge systems. For this reason, an index model by integrating water balance parameters (surface runoff, actual evapotranspiration, and percolation) calculated by Thornthwaite and Mather’s method, with maps of soil texture, land cover, and terrain slope, was developed for a sustainable use of the groundwater resources. The Serra de Santa Helena Environmental Protection Area, next to the urbanized area of Sete Lagoas (MG), Brazil, was selected as the study area. Rapid economic growth has led to the subsequent expansion of the nearby urban area. Large variability in soil type, land use, and slope in this region resulted in spatially complex relationships between recharge areas. Due to these conditions, the study area was divided into four zones, according to the amount of recharge: high (> 100 mm/year), moderate (50–100 mm/year), low (25–50 mm/year), and incipient (> 25 mm/year). The technique proved to be a viable method to estimate the spatial variability of recharge, especially in areas with little to no in situ data. The success of the tool indicates it can be used for a variety of groundwater resource management applications.},
